# Advent-of-Code-2025
Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** repository<br />
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2025">Advent of Code 2025</a>

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 challenges. My main goal this year is to give myself another reason to code, so while efficiency is not my primary focus, I am to solve every provlem correctly.

**Notes**:

<ul>
  <li>All solutions are written in C. (subject to change)</li>
  <li>Because all solutions are in C, every solution has been run through Valgrind to check for memory errors, overflows, seg-faults, etc.</li>
  <li>Solutions may not be optimized for performance. Most are brute forced approaches due to my limited time.</li>
  <li>In complience with Advent of Code rules, I don not share the official puzzle inputs. Instead, I have provided a small, modified input for testing based on the examples provided in the problem statements.</li>
</ul>

Please feel free to explore my solutions, get ideas, or follow along with the challenges yourself.
I only ask that you don't copy my code directly and instead try to challenge yourself and enjoy the fun of coding.

Happy coding! :)

Best wishes, Kyle Sherman
